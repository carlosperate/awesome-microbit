## Visual Programming Languages

- [Microsoft Blocks](https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code) - A Block interface that produces Touch Develop code.
- [Code Kingdoms](https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code) - A graphical interface that provides a transitioning experience from 'drag and drop' to text-based programming (JavaScript).
- [PXT](https://codethemicrobit.com) - The Programming eXperience Toolkit for the micro:bit provides a Blocks interface with more capabilities than Microsoft Blocks.


## Written Programming Languages

- [MicroPython](http://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io) - Port of MicroPython, a Python 3 implementation for microcontrollers and constrained environments.
- [C/C++ runtime](https://lancaster-university.github.io/microbit-docs) - The core set of drivers, mechanisms and types that make up the micro:bit runtime is written in C/C++, and can be used to easily interface with the micro:bit hardware.
- [Touch Develop](https://www.microbit.co.uk/create-code) - A flexible, text-based programming language with an interactive visual component.
- [PTX TypeScript](https://codethemicrobit.com) - The Programming eXperience Toolkit is based on a subset of TypeScript, which in itself is a superset of JavaScript.
- [Espruino JavaScript](http://www.espruino.com/MicroBit) - A JavaScript interpreter for microcontrollers. It also offers a WebIDE for written code and blocks.
- [Rust on BBC micro:bit](https://github.com/SimonSapin/rust-on-bbc-microbit) - Describes the experience and steps of compiling Rust code for the micro:bit with and without interaction with the runtime DAL.


## Online Code Editors

- [microbit website](https://www.microbit.co.uk) - Includes the Code Kingdoms, Microsoft Blocks, Touch Develop, and Python editors.
- [PTX](https://codethemicrobit.com) - Includes the Blocks and TypeScript editors for the Programming eXperience Toolkit.
- [create.withcode.uk](https://create.withcode.uk) - A Python online editor and simulator that supports the micro:bit MicroPython ([instructions](http://community.computingatschool.org.uk/resources/4479)).


## Desktop Code Editors

- [Mu](http://codewith.mu) - A "micro" editor for MicroPython and the BBC micro:bit.
- [Atom microbit-python package](https://github.com/Giannie/atom-microbit-python) - Flash Python code to your micro:bit directly from the [Atom text editor](https://atom.io).


## Programming Tools

- [Vagrant C/C++ Development Environment](https://github.com/carlosperate/microbit-dev-env) - With a single command it creates a virtual machine with all the toolchain required to compile and flash C/C++ programs to the micro:bit (including  MicroPython).
- [Android App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.microbit) - Connects and flashes programs to the micro:bit via Bluetooth.
- [iOS App](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/micro-bit/id1092687276) - Connects and flashes programs to the micro:bit via Bluetooth.
- [uFlash](https://github.com/ntoll/uflash/) - A utility for flashing the BBC micro:bit with Python scripts and the MicroPython runtime.
- [MicroFs](https://github.com/ntoll/microfs) - A simple command line tool and module for interacting with the limited file system provided by MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit.
- [micro:bit uploader](https://www.touchdevelop.com/microbituploader) - Windows application that monitors your Downloads forlder and flashes any new programs to the micro:bit. 


## Libraries

### Python

- [MicroPeri](https://github.com/JoeGlancy/microperi) - Run Python programs on your computer with the same micro:bit MicroPython API and connecting a micro:bit as an external peripheral device or sensor.
- [microbit_stub](https://github.com/casnortheast/microbit_stub) - A Python module that emulates the BBC microbit as defined by the microbit micropython API.


### Node.js

- [node-bbc-microbit](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/node-bbc-microbit) - Control a BBC micro:bit from Node.js using BLE.


## Projects

All these projects contain steps and resources required for reproduction.

- [Quiz:bit](https://github.com/lancaster-university/quiz-bit) - micro:bit programs and a matching application for providing a quiz-voter-style service using micro:bits as the controls.
